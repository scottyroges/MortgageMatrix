# Mortgage Matrix Project Rules

## Project Structure
- Components are organized in their own directories with the pattern:
  - ComponentName/
    - ComponentName.tsx
    - ComponentName.module.css
    - ComponentName.test.tsx
    - index.ts
- Use index.ts files for clean exports
- Group related components in logical directories

## Coding Standards
- Use TypeScript for all code files
- Use functional components with hooks
- Use named exports for components (export const Component = ...)
- Use CSS Modules for component styling
- Follow consistent naming conventions:
  - PascalCase for component names
  - camelCase for variables, functions, and instances
  - kebab-case for CSS class names

## Testing Practices
- Write tests for all components
- Use Vitest as the test runner
- Use React Testing Library for component testing
- Focus on testing behavior, not implementation details

## Styling Guidelines
- Use CSS Modules for component-specific styles
- Use semantic HTML elements
- Design with accessibility in mind
- Ensure responsive design for all components
