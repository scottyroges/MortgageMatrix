## What Works
- âœ… Project scaffolding with Vite, React, and TypeScript
- âœ… CSS Modules configuration
- âœ… Testing setup with Vitest and React Testing Library
- âœ… ESLint configuration with comprehensive rules for TypeScript, React, and accessibility
- âœ… Prettier setup for consistent code formatting
- âœ… Basic component architecture
- âœ… Header component with calculator icon and hamburger menu
- âœ… MainLayout component
- âœ… Home page component with Home Affordability Estimator
- âœ… Monthly Payment Calculator page
- âœ… Memory Bank documentation
- âœ… InputField component with currency formatting
- âœ… MinMaxSlider component for selecting ranges with dual thumbs
- âœ… Button component with primary/secondary variants
- âœ… ExpandableItem component for results display with two-line layout for taxes
- âœ… InfoSection component for explanatory content
- âœ… Footer component with social media icons
- âœ… TermSelector component for selecting loan term options
- âœ… Basic form validation
- âœ… Mobile-friendly responsive design
- âœ… UI fixes: Changed app background from dark grey to white
- âœ… Typography: Added IBM Plex Mono as the primary font
- âœ… Navigation: Implemented sticky header that remains at the top when scrolling
- âœ… UI improvement: Reduced spacing between header and page title
- âœ… UI enhancement: Updated input field styling with light background, consistent borders, and IBM Plex Mono font
- âœ… UI enhancement: Improved mobile experience by removing padding around the app in mobile view
- âœ… UI enhancement: Updated InfoSection background color to match design
- âœ… Calculation utilities for mortgage estimates and monthly payments
- âœ… AffordabilityEstimatorResults component for displaying dynamic calculation results with detailed interest rate breakdowns
- âœ… Integration of UI with calculation logic to display actual affordable house prices and monthly payments

## What's Left to Build
- ðŸ”² Advanced form validation
- ðŸ”² Visualization components (charts, graphs)
- ðŸ”² Comparison feature
- ðŸ”² Amortization schedule
- ðŸ”² Additional screens/pages
- ðŸ”² Routing between pages
- ðŸ”² State management for sharing data
- ðŸ”² Accessibility enhancements
- ðŸ”² Unit and integration tests for new components

## Current Status
The project has progressed from initial setup to having two fully functional calculator screens. We have implemented both the Home Affordability Estimator and the Monthly Payment Calculator with all the necessary UI components according to the designs. 

For the Home Affordability Estimator, the form inputs, sliders, and expandable results section are all working as expected with actual calculation data. We've created a dedicated AffordabilityEstimatorResults component to display the calculation results in a clean, organized way.

For the Monthly Payment Calculator, we've implemented a form with home price, down payment (with percentage calculation), loan term selection, interest rate, taxes, insurance, and HOA inputs. The calculator displays the monthly payment amount after the user clicks the Calculate button.

The mortgage calculation utilities have been implemented and integrated with the UI, allowing users to see affordable house prices and monthly payments based on their inputs. We've created a new TermSelector component for selecting loan term options with a button group interface.

The mobile view has been improved by removing unnecessary padding and ensuring the forms are responsive on smaller screens.

## Known Issues
- No significant issues at this stage
- Form validation is basic and could be enhanced
- Tests for new components need to be implemented
